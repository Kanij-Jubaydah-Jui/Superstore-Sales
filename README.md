# Superstore-Sales
This is an analysis project for superstore sales.

## Overview
This project demonstrates RFM (Recency, Frequency and Monetary) segmentation using MySQL on Superstore Sales Data to classify customers into different segments based on their transaction history.

## Files
- `Superstore_Sales_Data.csv`: The raw sales data file.
- `Create_database & Bulk Insertion.sql`: This SQL script will create the database and tables.
- `Exploring and cleaning the data.sql`: Exploring the data and checking if all the data is in proper format then doing the necessary cleaning and update the table.
- `EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis).sql`: This will perform Exploratory Data Analysis.
- `RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) segmentation.sql`: Segment the customer using RFM segmentation.

## Methodology
1. Data Preparation with MySQL & Cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. RFM Segmentation (Recency, Frequency and Monetary)

## Findings
Customer segmentation is a critical process for businesses to understand their customers' purchasing behaviors and improve targeted marketing strategies. By segmenting customers based on their purchasing behavior, businesses can tailor their marketing strategies to target different customer groups effectively.

The goal is to:

- Identify high-value customers.
- Improve customer retention strategies.
- Optimize marketing efforts for different customer segments.
- I use MySQL for data preparation, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA) and RFM segmentation.
- Created a database in MySQL and imported the Superstore Sales Data.
- Checked for missing values, incorrect data formats and inconsistencies. Updated table schema and cleaned data for better analysis.
- Analyzed customer purchasing trends, sales distribution and order patterns.
- Identified outliers and anomalies in sales and profits.
- I calculated the three key metrics for each customer:
  Recency (R) – How recently did the customer make a purchase?
  Frequency (F) – How often do they make purchases?
  Monetary (M) – How much do they spend?

In this portfolio project, the majority of revenue comes from a small percentage of highly loyal customers. Some customers purchase frequently but spend less, while others buy less often but spend significantly more. Also, identified at-risk customers who haven't purchased recently and need re-engagement.

So, the project successfully segments customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior.
